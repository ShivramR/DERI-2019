An Analysis of Twitter Users Political Views using Cross-Account Data Mining

## Rationale
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, polling largely failed to predict the upset and victory of Donald Trump. In the United States, more than 70% of the population are social media users and as one of the most popular social network websites, Twitter has exceeded a hundred million daily users and nearly one billion total users. This diverse range on one universal platform leads to the representation of almost any political view. Therefore, as a more accurate predictor for the upcoming election year and possible future elections, it could be beneficial to look at the change in the opinions of users across a relatively long period of time. In this paper, we conducted a study on the political view migration through following up a selected group of Twitter users over the period of three years.

## Accomplishments
* Analyzed political trends of a random sample of 60,491 US-based Twitter users
* Developed and deployed a seed-based algorithm for classfifying political shifts
* Formed a testable network-based classification model
* Reached and manually verified a conclusion of more moderate positions in a cyclical manner

## Future work
* Expanding the sample size
* Explore political deviations between Twitter and other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram
* Verify the classification algorithm with other datasets
* Potentially introduce natural language processing for greater classification accuracy
